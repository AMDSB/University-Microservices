     *
     * ```
     * "deletable": true
     * ```
     *
     * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
     * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
     * for each enabled code scanning tool,
     * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
     *
     * * `ref`
     * * `tool`
     * * `category`
     *
     * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
     * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
     *
     * ```
     * Analysis specified is not deletable.
     * ```
     *
     * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
     * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
     * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
     * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
     * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
     * for the specified tool in your repository.
     * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
     * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
     * in the 200 response is `null`.
     *
     * As an example of the deletion process,
     * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
     * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
     * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
     * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
     * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
     * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
     * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
     * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
     * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
     * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
     * Then repeat the process for the second set.
     * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
     *
     * **Outer loop**:
     * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
     * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
     *
     *   **Inner loop**:
     *   * Delete the identified analysis.
     *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
     *
     * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

     *
     * To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination:
     *
     * - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.
     * - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.

     * Files and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) for
     * retrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media

     *
     * **Notes**:

     * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#get-a-tree).
     *  *  Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
     * #### Size limits
     * If the requested file's size is:
     * * 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
     * * Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` [custom media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents#custom-media-types-for-repository-contents) are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
     *  * Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.
     *
     * #### If the content is a directory
     * The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.
     * When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value
     * _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).
     * In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
     *
     * #### If the content is a symlink
     * If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the
     * API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object
     * describing the symlink itself.
     *
     * #### If the content is a submodule
     * The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
     * commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
     * the submodule at that specific commit.
     *
     * If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
     * github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.
